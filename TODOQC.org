For leo:
  - Dec seems not to be working as intended.  He hoped that the ? would not
    be necessary to coerce a (decidable) Prop to a Checkable...
  - Can we make every EqDec automatically be a Dec?
  - Does the QC command actually fail if the testing fails??  Could it?
  - The QuickChick command should print which property it tested.
  - Perhaps the normal (or at least a selectable) behavior of the QuickChick
    command should be to print nothing at all if checking succeeds.
  - Can we avoid re-extracting and recompiling the whole file every time we
    run QuickChick?? 
      - It's too slow, probably in large part because we're recompiling too
        much.
  * Make a simpler tactic for deriving equality.
       Derive Arbitrary, Show, Eq for file_access_mode.
  * play with precedence for ? -- should bind tigher than implication

MINOR:
  - Add
       Set Warnings "-notation-overridden,-parsing".
    to .v files to get rid of compilation warnings.
  - Suppress Debug messages
  - When displaying counterexamples, would it be easy to print the name of
    each bound variable along with the failing value that's been found for
    it? 

__________

About decidability:
  - How do I create a Dec instance for options?  
  - Need better (infix) notations for boolean operations (andb, orb, negb,
    implies, etc.) 
  - How should we phrase specs like the one for filesystem operations in DW?
    Is there a way of using Dec to (semi?-)automatically calculate decision
    procedures for things like /\ and forall formulas?


TASKS FOR THE SUMMER SCHOOL:
  - documentation 
  - test opam package

___________

Random observations:
  - Extraction doesn't work if any definitions are Admitted.  But in a
    testing context, it might actually be better to give them wrong
    definitions (and then discover that fact)!
