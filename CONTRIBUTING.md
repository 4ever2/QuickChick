The master branch of QuickChick is pull-request based only.
It is used to track the developmental branch of Coq for use in the Coq CI. 
Only pull requests from Coq developers will be accepted for the master branch.
If you want to contribute to QuickChick, see below.

If you want to contribute OCaml code to the plugin you must use the dev branch.
The dev branch closely follows master and ensures that any ocaml code does not 
become obsolete.

If you want to contribute to QuickChick on the Coq/documentation side of things and your
change is 8.8 compatible, you can choose to submit a pull request to the latest stable 
version (8.8) or otherwise to the dev branch for use in a future release.
