FLOW OF TOPICS

Basic QC
  - completely automatic behavior
      - a few simple exercises -- find the bug in XX

small examples (lists and similar)

Coq typeclasses (intro)
  TypeClasses.v

core QC typeclasses
  - generator monad
     - basic combinators (elements, oneOf, ...)
     - exercises: build a generator for XX
     - CoArbitrary
     - generators for polymorphic properties (nat, Li-Yao stuff, etc.)
  - shrinking
      - build a custom shrinker for XX
      - question: what is wrong with this shrinker?  
           - might generate the same example
           - might generate larger examples
