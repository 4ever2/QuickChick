FLOW OF TOPICS

Basic QC
  - completely automatic behavior
      - a few simple exercises -- find the bug in XX

small examples (lists and similar)

Coq typeclasses (intro)
  TypeClasses.v

core QC typeclasses
  - generator monad
     - basic combinators (elements, oneOf, ...)
     - exercises: build a generator for XX
     - CoArbitrary
     - generators for polymorphic properties (nat, Li-Yao stuff, etc.)
  - shrinking
      - build a custom shrinker for XX
      - question: what is wrong with this shrinker?  
           - might generate the same example
           - might generate larger examples

(talk about the fact that longer test cases often find examples better --
see John's talk, and perhaps even use the "1-2-3-4-5 in order" example in
detail)

ways of measuring distributions
   "Tuning random distributions is 
      - a creative process
      - based on observations
      - highly effective"
   (and see other observations in John's talk)

code coverage is a very bad success metric, but a rather good heuristic for
when your tests are not good enough

mutation testing
  
final comments about testing
  - simple properties: very high payoff
      - round trip properties
      - regression testing
  - invariants that are going to be used for proof
  - complete specs may have smaller payoff
