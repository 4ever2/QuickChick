(** * Basics *)

(** ** First Example: The [Show] Typeclass *)

(* Motivation: Need to be able to convert lots of things to strings... 
     - show : A -> String

   Similar examples:
     - sort : list A -> list A
     - eqb : A -> A -> bool      (is that the right name?)
     - + : A -> A -> A
     - serialize : A -> BitString
     - hash : A -> Int
     - etc., etc.

  Coq adopts (and adapts) Haskell's notion of _typeclasses_ for this.
*)

(* Class declaration: *)
Class Show (A : Type) : Type :=
{
  show : A -> string
}.

Check Show.  (* explain the output! *)
Check show.  (* explain the output! *)

(* Instance declaration: *)
Instance showBool : Show bool :=
  {|
    show := fun b:bool => if b then "true" else "false"
  |}.

Compute (show true).

Definition natToDigit (n : nat) : string :=
  match n with
    | 0 => "0" | 1 => "1" | 2 => "2" | 3 => "3" | 4 => "4" | 5 => "5"
    | 6 => "6" | 7 => "7" | 8 => "8" | _ => "9"
  end.

Fixpoint writeNatAux (time n : nat) (acc : string) : string :=
  let acc' := (natToDigit (n mod 10)) ++ acc in
  match time with
    | 0 => acc'
    | S time' =>
      match n / 10 with
        | 0 => acc'
        | n' => writeNatAux time' n' acc'
      end
  end.

Definition string_of_nat (n : nat) : string :=
  writeNatAux n n "".

Instance showNat : Show nat :=
  {|
    show := string_of_nat
  |}.

Compute (show 42).

Instance showString : Show string :=
  {|
    show := fun s:string => """" ++ s ++ """"
  |}.

Compute (show true).

(* Exercise: Write show instance for pairs of a nat and a bool. *)

(* One downside of using typeclasses is that error messages get more
   puzzling (sometimes substantially so).  Here is a common one. *)
(*
Inductive foo :=
  Foo : nat -> foo.

Definition showMyList :=
  show (Foo 43).

===> 
      Error: Unable to satisfy the following constraints:
      ?Show : "Show foo"

To fix it, we just have to define a new instance... (do it, or ask them to)
*)

(* What if we *)

Definition showFancy {A : Type} `{Show A} (a : A): string :=
  "((((((((((( " ++ show a ++ " )))))))))))".

Compute (showFancy true).


(* Explain: What does the ` syntax mean?  Note that we can name the
   parameter if we want -- i.e., `{Show A} is just the same as `{_ :
   Show A}. Explain when you'd need to do this, or better yet explain
   it below and put a pointer here. *)

(* Recommended exercise: What happens if we forget the class
   constraint?  Try deleting it and see what happens.  Do you
   understand why? *)

(* MAYBE: Show one more simple typeclass, perhaps equality *)

(* Remark for newcomers: the name "typeclasses" may sound a bit like
   "classes" from OOP.  But this is misleading.  A better analogy is
   actually with _interfaces_ from languages like Java.  But best of
   all is to set aside OO preconceptions and try to approach the
   situation with an open mind. *)

(* More Ideas...  *)

(* What does "Polymorphic Instance" mean? *)

(** Pragmatics *)

(* A potential gotcha:
 
The problem appears to be when using the (universe-polymorphic) inject
function in conjunction with a typeclass method, when the necessary
instance doesn't exist.

Inductive Foo := MkFoo : Foo.
  Set Typeclasses Debug.

  Instance gen : Gen (list Foo) := {| arbitrary := liftGen inject
    arbitrary |}.

Leo: My goto debug method is to try to manually expand the
typeclasses. Before that, I needed to understand what ‚Äúinject‚Äù
was. Since the result type was list of X, I assumed that inject is
similar to using ‚Äúpure‚Äù or ‚Äúreturn‚Äù in Haskell instead of (fun x =>
[x]). However, Coq is really bad usually at figuring out implicit
stuff ‚Äì so I just replaced it by the explicit anonymous function.
 
After that it was just a ‚ÄúGen (list X) instance does not exist‚Äù, so
deriving Arbitrary (or Gen) for X should work (and it did). Now, why
things work when moving back to ‚Äúinject‚Äù after adding the instance I
have no idea üòä


Yao: I have discussed this with Leo. The problem is that I have
defined the following instance:

Polymorphic Instance Injection_trans {A B C : Type} {P : Injection A
            B} {Q : Injection B C} : Injection A C := { inject e :=
            inject (inject e) }.

This would cause the type checker to go to an infinite loop if it
recursively takes this branch before exploring other
possibilities. Removing this instance would fix the problem.

We don‚Äôt see other problems with this Injection type class for
now. Therefore, I suggest we keep this type class, but be careful not
to define something similar to what I did.

EXERCISE: Find a different way of making instance inference diverge.

(* Hint: If confused, you can look at the *coq* buffer. That's where
most debug messages appear if they don't appear in the *response*
buffer.  (What's a typical example of this? *)
