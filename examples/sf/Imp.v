(** HP Calculators, programming languages like Forth and Postscript
    and abstract machines like the Java Virtual Machine all evaluate
    arithmetic expressions using a stack. For instance, the expression

      (2*3)+(3*(4-2))

   would be entered as

      2 3 * 3 4 2 - * +

   and evaluated like this (where we show the program being evaluated
   on the right and the contents of the stack on the left):

      [ ]           |    2 3 * 3 4 2 - * +
      [2]           |    3 * 3 4 2 - * +

      [6, 6]        |    +
      [12]          |

  The task of this exercise is to write a small compiler that
  translates [aexp]s into stack machine instructions.

  The instruction set for our stack language will consist of the
  following instructions:
     - [SPush n]: Push the number [n] on the stack.
     - [SLoad x]: Load the identifier [x] from the store and push it
                  on the stack
     - [SPlus]:   Pop the two top numbers from the stack, add them, and
                  push the result onto the stack.
     - [SMinus]:  Similar, but subtract.
     - [SMult]:   Similar, but multiply. *)

Inductive sinstr : Type :=
| SPush : nat -> sinstr
| SLoad : id -> sinstr
| SPlus : sinstr
| SMinus : sinstr
| SMult : sinstr.

(** Write a function to evaluate programs in the stack language. It
    should take as input a state, a stack represented as a list of
    numbers (top stack item is the head of the list), and a program
    represented as a list of instructions, and it should return the
    stack after executing the program.  Test your function on the
    examples below.

    Note that the specification leaves unspecified what to do when
    encountering an [SPlus], [SMinus], or [SMult] instruction if the
    stack contains less than two elements.  In a sense, it is
    immaterial what we do, since our compiler will never emit such a
    malformed program. *)

(** Next, write a function that compiles an [aexp] into a stack
    machine program. The effect of running the program should be the
    same as pushing the value of the expression on the stack. *)

    [SMult] instruction if the stack contains less than two
    elements.  (In order to make your correctness proof easier you
    might find it helpful to go back and change your implementation!)

    Prove the following theorem.  You will need to start by stating a
    more general lemma to get a usable induction hypothesis; the main
    theorem will then be a simple corollary of this lemma. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, optional (short_circuit)  *)
(** Most modern programming languages use a "short-circuit" evaluation
    rule for boolean [and]: to evaluate [BAnd b1 b2], first evaluate
    [b1].  If it evaluates to [false], then the entire [BAnd]
    expression evaluates to [false] immediately, without evaluating
    [b2].  Otherwise, [b2] is evaluated to determine the result of the
    [BAnd] expression.

    Write an alternate version of [beval] that performs short-circuit
    evaluation of [BAnd] in this manner, and prove that it is
    equivalent to [beval]. *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, advanced (break_imp)  *)

(** Imperative languages like C and Java often include a [break] or
    similar statement for interrupting the execution of loops. In this
    exercise we consider how to add [break] to Imp.  First, we need to
    enrich the language of commands with an additional case. *)

Notation "'IFB' c1 'THEN' c2 'ELSE' c3 'FI'" :=
  (CIf c1 c2 c3) (at level 80, right associativity).

(** Next, we need to define the behavior of [BREAK].  Informally,
    whenever [BREAK] is executed in a sequence of commands, it stops
    the execution of that sequence and signals that the innermost
    enclosing loop should terminate.  (If there aren't any
    enclosing loops, then the whole program simply terminates.)  The
    final state should be the same as the one in which the [BREAK]
    statement was executed.

    One important point is what to do when there are multiple loops
    enclosing a given [BREAK]. In those cases, [BREAK] should only
    terminate the _innermost_ loop. Thus, after executing the
    following...

       X ::= 0;;
       Y ::= 1;;
       WHILE 0 <> Y DO
         WHILE TRUE DO
           BREAK
         END;;
         X ::= 1;;
         Y ::= Y - 1
       END

    ... the value of [X] should be [1], and not [0].

    One way of expressing this behavior is to add another parameter to
    the evaluation relation that specifies whether evaluation of a
    command executes a [BREAK] statement: *)

                  (at level 40, st, s at level 39).

(** Intuitively, [c / st \\ s / st'] means that, if [c] is started in
    state [st], then it terminates in state [st'] and either signals
    that the innermost surrounding loop (or the whole program) should
    exit immediately ([s = SBreak]) or that execution should continue
    normally ([s = SContinue]).

    The definition of the "[c / st \\ s / st']" relation is very
    similar to the one we gave above for the regular evaluation
    relation ([c / st \\ st']) -- we just need to handle the
    termination signals appropriately:

    - If the command is [SKIP], then the state doesn't change and
      execution of any enclosing loop can continue normally.

    - If the command is [BREAK], the state stays unchanged but we
      signal a [SBreak].

    - If the command is an assignment, then we update the binding for
      that variable in the state accordingly and signal that execution
      can continue normally.

    - If the command is of the form [IFB b THEN c1 ELSE c2 FI], then
      the state is updated as in the original semantics of Imp, except
      that we also propagate the signal from the execution of
      whichever branch was taken.

    - If the command is a sequence [c1 ;; c2], we first execute
      [c1].  If this yields a [SBreak], we skip the execution of [c2]
      and propagate the [SBreak] signal to the surrounding context;
      the resulting state is the same as the one obtained by
      executing [c1] alone. Otherwise, we execute [c2] on the state
      obtained after executing [c1], and propagate the signal
      generated there.

    - Finally, for a loop of the form [WHILE b DO c END], the
      semantics is almost the same as before. The only difference is
      that, when [b] evaluates to true, we execute [c] and check the
      signal that it raises.  If that signal is [SContinue], then the
      execution proceeds as in the original semantics. Otherwise, we
      stop the execution of the loop, and the resulting state is the
      same as the one resulting from the execution of the current
      iteration.  In either case, since [BREAK] only terminates the
      innermost loop, [WHILE] signals [SContinue]. *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, optional (add_for_loop)  *)
(** Add C-style [for] loops to the language of commands, update the
    [ceval] definition to define the semantics of [for] loops, and add
    cases for [for] loops as needed so that all the proofs in this file
    are accepted by Coq.

    A [for] loop should be parameterized by (a) a statement executed
    initially, (b) a test that is run on each iteration of the loop to
    determine whether the loop should continue, (c) a statement
    executed at the end of each loop iteration, and (d) a statement
    that makes up the body of the loop.  (You don't need to worry
    about making up a concrete Notation for [for] loops, but feel free
    to play with this too if you like.) *)
