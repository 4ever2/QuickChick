Theorem plus_id_example : forall n m : nat, n = m -> n + n = m + m.
Admitted. QuickChick plus_id_example.

(** The first line of the proof moves the universally quantified
    variables [n] and [m] into the context.  The second moves the
    hypothesis [n = m] into the context and gives it the name [H].
    The third tells Coq to rewrite the current goal ([n + n = m + m])
    by replacing the left side of the equality hypothesis [H] with the
    right side.

    (The arrow symbol in the [rewrite] has nothing to do with
    implication: it tells Coq to apply the rewrite from left to right.
    To rewrite from right to left, you can use [rewrite <-].  Try
    making this change in the above proof and see what difference it
    makes.) *)

Theorem plus_id_exercise : forall n m o : nat,
  n = m -> m = o -> n + m = m + o.
Proof.
  (* FILL IN HERE *) Admitted.
(** [] *)

(** The [Admitted] command tells Coq that we want to skip trying
    to prove this theorem and just accept it as a given.  This can be
    useful for developing longer proofs, since we can state subsidiary
    lemmas that we believe will be useful for making some larger
    argument, use [Admitted] to accept them on faith for the moment,
    and continue working on the main argument until we are sure it
    makes sense; then we can go back and fill in the proofs we
    skipped.  Be careful, though: every time you say [Admitted] you
    are leaving a door open for total nonsense to enter Coq's nice,
    rigorous, formally checked world! *)

(** We can also use the [rewrite] tactic with a previously proved
    theorem instead of a hypothesis from the context. If the statement
    of the previously proved theorem involves quantified variables,
    as in the example below, Coq tries to instantiate them
    by matching with the current goal. *)

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Proof by Case Analysis *)

(** Of course, not everything can be proved by simple
    calculation and rewriting: In general, unknown, hypothetical
    values (arbitrary numbers, booleans, lists, etc.) can block
    simplification.  For example, if we try to prove the following
    fact using the [simpl] tactic as above, we get stuck. *)


Theorem plus_1_neq_0_firsttry : forall n : nat,
  beq_nat (n + 1) 0 = false.
Admitted.
Proof.
  intros n.
  simpl.  (* does nothing! *)
Abort.

(** The reason for this is that the definitions of both
    [beq_nat] and [+] begin by performing a [match] on their first
    argument.  But here, the first argument to [+] is the unknown
    number [n] and the argument to [beq_nat] is the compound
    expression [n + 1]; neither can be simplified.

    To make progress, we need to consider the possible forms of [n]
    separately.  If [n] is [O], then we can calculate the final result
    of [beq_nat (n + 1) 0] and check that it is, indeed, [false].  And
    if [n = S n'] for some [n'], then, although we don't know exactly
    what number [n + 1] yields, we can calculate that, at least, it
    will begin with one [S], and this is enough to calculate that,
    again, [beq_nat (n + 1) 0] will yield [false].

    The tactic that tells Coq to consider, separately, the cases where
    [n = O] and where [n = S n'] is called [destruct]. *)

Theorem plus_1_neq_0 : forall n : nat,
  beq_nat (n + 1) 0 = false.
Proof.
  intros n. destruct n as [| n'].
  - reflexivity.
  - reflexivity.   Qed.

(** The [destruct] generates _two_ subgoals, which we must then
    prove, separately, in order to get Coq to accept the theorem. The
    annotation "[as [| n']]" is called an _intro pattern_.  It tells
    Coq what variable names to introduce in each subgoal.  In general,
    what goes between the square brackets is a _list of lists_ of
    names, separated by [|].  In this case, the first component is
    empty, since the [O] constructor is nullary (it doesn't have any
    arguments).  The second component gives a single name, [n'], since
    [S] is a unary constructor.

    The [-] signs on the second and third lines are called _bullets_,
    and they mark the parts of the proof that correspond to each
    generated subgoal.  The proof script that comes after a bullet is
    the entire proof for a subgoal.  In this example, each of the
    subgoals is easily proved by a single use of [reflexivity], which
    itself performs some simplification -- e.g., the first one
    simplifies [beq_nat (S n' + 1) 0] to [false] by first rewriting
    [(S n' + 1)] to [S (n' + 1)], then unfolding [beq_nat], and then
    simplifying the [match].

    Marking cases with bullets is entirely optional: if bullets are
    not present, Coq simply asks you to prove each subgoal in
    sequence, one at a time. But it is a good idea to use bullets.
    For one thing, they make the structure of a proof apparent, making
    it more readable. Also, bullets instruct Coq to ensure that a
    subgoal is complete before trying to verify the next one,
    preventing proofs for different subgoals from getting mixed
    up. These issues become especially important in large
    developments, where fragile proofs lead to long debugging
    sessions.

    There are no hard and fast rules for how proofs should be
    formatted in Coq -- in particular, where lines should be broken
    and how sections of the proof should be indented to indicate their
    nested structure.  However, if the places where multiple subgoals
    are generated are marked with explicit bullets at the beginning of
    lines, then the proof will be readable almost no matter what
    choices are made about other aspects of layout.

    This is also a good place to mention one other piece of somewhat
    obvious advice about line lengths.  Beginning Coq users sometimes
    tend to the extremes, either writing each tactic on its own line
    or writing entire proofs on one line.  Good style lies somewhere
    in the middle.  One reasonable convention is to limit yourself to
    80-character lines.

    The [destruct] tactic can be used with any inductively defined
    datatype.  For example, we use it next to prove that boolean
    negation is involutive -- i.e., that negation is its own
    inverse. *)

Theorem negb_involutive : forall b : bool,
  negb (negb b) = b.
Proof.
  intros b. destruct b.
  - reflexivity.
  - reflexivity.  Qed.

(** Note that the [destruct] here has no [as] clause because
    none of the subcases of the [destruct] need to bind any variables,
    so there is no need to specify any names.  (We could also have
    written [as [|]], or [as []].)  In fact, we can omit the [as]
    clause from _any_ [destruct] and Coq will fill in variable names
    automatically.  This is generally considered bad style, since Coq
    often makes confusing choices of names when left to its own
    devices.

    It is sometimes useful to invoke [destruct] inside a subgoal,
    generating yet more proof obligations. In this case, we use
    different kinds of bullets to mark goals on different "levels."
    For example: *)

Theorem andb_commutative : forall b c, andb b c = andb c b.
Proof.
  intros b c. destruct b.
  - destruct c.
    + reflexivity.
    + reflexivity.
  - destruct c.
    + reflexivity.
    + reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Each pair of calls to [reflexivity] corresponds to the
    subgoals that were generated after the execution of the [destruct c]
    line right above it. *)

(** Besides [-] and [+], we can use [*] (asterisk) as a third kind of
    bullet.  We can also enclose sub-proofs in curly braces, which is
    useful in case we ever encounter a proof that generates more than
    three levels of subgoals: *)

Theorem andb_commutative' : forall b c, andb b c = andb c b.
Proof.
  intros b c. destruct b.
  { destruct c.
    { reflexivity. }
    { reflexivity. } }
  { destruct c.
    { reflexivity. }
    { reflexivity. } }
Qed.

(** Since curly braces mark both the beginning and the end of a
    proof, they can be used for multiple subgoal levels, as this
    example shows. Furthermore, curly braces allow us to reuse the
    same bullet shapes at multiple levels in a proof: *)

Theorem andb3_exchange :
  forall b c d, andb (andb b c) d = andb (andb b d) c.
Proof.
  intros b c d. destruct b.
  - destruct c.
    { destruct d.
      - reflexivity.
      - reflexivity. }
    { destruct d.
      - reflexivity.
      - reflexivity. }
  - destruct c.
    { destruct d.
      - reflexivity.
      - reflexivity. }
    { destruct d.
      - reflexivity.
      - reflexivity. }
Qed.

(** Before closing the chapter, let's mention one final
    convenience.  As you may have noticed, many proofs perform case
    analysis on a variable right after introducing it:

       intros x y. destruct y as [|y].

    This pattern is so common that Coq provides a shorthand for it: we
    can perform case analysis on a variable when introducing it by
    using an intro pattern instead of a variable name. For instance,
    here is a shorter proof of the [plus_1_neq_0] theorem above. *)

Theorem plus_1_neq_0' : forall n : nat,
  beq_nat (n + 1) 0 = false.

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** More on Notation (Optional) *)

(** (In general, sections marked Optional are not needed to follow the
    rest of the book, except possibly other Optional sections.  On a
    first reading, you might want to skim these sections so that you
    know what's there for future reference.)

    Recall the notation definitions for infix plus and times: *)

Notation "x + y" := (plus x y)
                       (at level 50, left associativity)
                       : nat_scope.
Notation "x * y" := (mult x y)
                       (at level 40, left associativity)
                       : nat_scope.

(** For each notation symbol in Coq, we can specify its _precedence
    level_ and its _associativity_.  The precedence level [n] is
    specified by writing [at level n]; this helps Coq parse compound
    expressions.  The associativity setting helps to disambiguate
    expressions containing multiple occurrences of the same
    symbol. For example, the parameters specified above for [+] and
    [*] say that the expression [1+2*3*4] is shorthand for
    [(1+((2*3)*4))]. Coq uses precedence levels from 0 to 100, and
    _left_, _right_, or _no_ associativity.  We will see more examples
    of this later, e.g., in the [Lists]
    chapter.

    Each notation symbol is also associated with a _notation scope_.
    Coq tries to guess what scope is meant from context, so when it
    sees [S(O*O)] it guesses [nat_scope], but when it sees the
    cartesian product (tuple) type [bool*bool] (which we'll see in
    later chapters) it guesses [type_scope].  Occasionally, it is
    necessary to help it out with percent-notation by writing
    [(x*y)%nat], and sometimes in what Coq prints it will use [%nat]
    to indicate what scope a notation is in.

    Notation scopes also apply to numeral notation ([3], [4], [5],
    etc.), so you may sometimes see [0%nat], which means [O] (the
    natural number [0] that we're using in this chapter), or [0%Z],
    which means the Integer zero (which comes from a different part of
    the standard library).

    Pro tip: Coq's notation mechanism is not especially powerful.
    Don't expect too much from it! *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Fixpoints and Structural Recursion (Optional) *)

(** Here is a copy of the definition of addition: *)

Fixpoint plus' (n : nat) (m : nat) : nat :=
  match n with
  | O => m
  | S n' => S (plus' n' m)
  end.

(** When Coq checks this definition, it notes that [plus'] is
    "decreasing on 1st argument."  What this means is that we are
    performing a _structural recursion_ over the argument [n] -- i.e.,
    that we make recursive calls only on strictly smaller values of
    [n].  This implies that all calls to [plus'] will eventually
    terminate.  Coq demands that some argument of _every_ [Fixpoint]
    definition is "decreasing."

    This requirement is a fundamental feature of Coq's design: In
    particular, it guarantees that every function that can be defined
    in Coq will terminate on all inputs.  However, because Coq's
    "decreasing analysis" is not very sophisticated, it is sometimes
    necessary to write functions in slightly unnatural ways. *)

(** **** Exercise: 2 stars, optional (decreasing)  *)
(** To get a concrete sense of this, find a way to write a sensible
    [Fixpoint] definition (of a simple function on numbers, say) that
    _does_ terminate on all inputs, but that Coq will reject because
    of this restriction. *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 starsM (binary)  *)
(** Consider a different, more efficient representation of natural
    numbers using a binary rather than unary system.  That is, instead
    of saying that each natural number is either zero or the successor
    of a natural number, we can say that each binary number is either

      - zero,
      - twice a binary number, or
      - one more than twice a binary number.

    (a) First, write an inductive definition of the type [bin]
        corresponding to this description of binary numbers.

    (Hint: Recall that the definition of [nat] above,

         Inductive nat : Type := | O : nat | S : nat -> nat.

    says nothing about what [O] and [S] "mean."  It just says "[O] is
    in the set called [nat], and if [n] is in the set then so is [S
    n]."  The interpretation of [O] as zero and [S] as successor/plus
    one comes from the way that we _use_ [nat] values, by writing
    functions to do things with them, proving things about them, and
    so on.  Your definition of [bin] should be correspondingly simple;
    it is the functions you will write next that will give it
    mathematical meaning.)

    (b) Next, write an increment function [incr] for binary numbers,
        and a function [bin_to_nat] to convert binary numbers to unary
        numbers.

    (c) Write five unit tests [test_bin_incr1], [test_bin_incr2], etc.
        for your increment and binary-to-unary functions.  (A "unit
        test" in Coq is a specific [Example] that can be proved with
        just [reflexivity], as we've done for several of our
        definitions.)  Notice that incrementing a binary number and
        then converting it to unary should yield the same result as
        first converting it to unary and then incrementing. *)
